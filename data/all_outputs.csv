zHAR8MmCbjrkNnLGm1ozEQ,"The food here is served fast and fresh, but it is a little expensive for a small joint like this. However, the portions are large. Some dishes taste a little bland and dry, like the chicken fries and carnitas torta. The service is friendly, but the atmosphere can be loud with the TV.","It's a Mexican restaurant, but the food is delicious. I had the carne asada fries and a carne asada burrito. Both were delicious. Service was fast and friendly. I would definitely go back.","food was good but a little expensive for a dive. $7.99 for a chicken quesadilla, no rice or beans. friendly service, tv was so loud it was uncomfortable, staff didn't seem to <UNK> i'm eating a overwhelming smell of pinesol cleaner overtook the taste of my food. between loud tv and cleaner, i won't be back","goes to show that just because a restaurant has a high rating, doesn't necessarily mean it is great. three stars because the food was edible. ordered the chicken fries, cheese quesadilla and a carnitas torta. the three of us thought the food was bland and the meats dry. it's okay, but not great.","the food is good, the place is clean, and the staff is friendly. i became an instant rivas fan after trying what i think is the best chicken burrito in town. make sure to try the avocado sauce too! yum! the carne asada fries are an excellent choice as well.","ordered through uber eats. got 2 chicken enchiladas, pastor fries, plain nachos, and a large sprite. the enchiladas and fries were good. but the soda was unflavored carbonated water, and 'plain nachos' is just chips. i figured nachos would at least come with cheese.","this place is very delicious. i've had the chicken tacos, chicken quesadilla, and the california burrito and they were all very delicious. the horchata and <UNK> are also very good! i definitely recommend this place, don't ever go back to roberto's!",came here for the steak fries after reading the reviews. food was served quickly and everything tasted pretty good and seemed fresh. the portion size was <UNK> too much to eat. i definitely want to come back and try some of the other menu items.,the wife and i moved to area from san diego. heard good about this place. the food looked great. we got our order and it was cold. such a big disappointment. i will continue to look for a 'good <UNK>,rivas mexican grill sin duda alguna lo recomiendo variedad de comida mexicana. es una delicia. no hay algo q este en el menú que no me guste. por la atención calidad de personal. el restaurant super limpio un ambiente agradable.
zJzkL4VHHksVVGepR1IAGw,"The food at this restaurant is generally well-liked. Most of the food is very good, though some items might only be considered OK. The service, for the most part, is good, though can be slow sometimes. This restaurant is recommended overall. It is not always the best, but should not disappoint.","The food here is amazing! Service was attentive and the food was very tasty. We had the chicken and waffles, which was delicious. The only thing I didn't like was the poutine, but it was a bit too salty for me.","went to have brunch for mother's day and found the modern, nautical decor charming and the service very fast & friendly! had the chicken & waffles which were the best mix of sweet & savoury with a hint of heat! the toffee crunch bar for desserts was decadent but somehow still light & airy! i'm excited to go back for dinner!","my boyfriend loved this restaurant although we found that their meat platter was overcooked. drinks were good, dessert was good. server was personable and cool. the shawarma was just plain bad- no flavour and pretty expensive. this restaurant is creative and unique, it deserves to succeed. it just needs to fine tune it's menu a bit.","came here for brunch; it's in a cool part of roncy. started with the beignets and had the english breakfast for the main. the beignets were <UNK> much icing sugar, fresh out the oven, melt in your mouth good. the english breakfast was pretty standard, solid meal but nothing too mind-blowing.","food here is really good however i will say this is not a place if you're looking for value. portions are very small and prices are a little pricey. the quality is there though. as others were saying, the donairs are really good! definitely order those if you haven't tried them.","i do like this place, the food is great, but the service was just brutal on our visit for our 7th year anniversary. i wanted to cut the waiter out of the equation and run our own food. what does a guy have to do around here to get a dirty martini.","the food was delicious! the wait staff really friendly and attentive. probably some of the best i've ever had. we tried the crispy pig ear salad, oysters, donairs, lobster spaghetti, cauliflower clams and crispy toffee for desert. i would definitely not leave without trying the lobster spaghetti.","sweet, spicy and get outta here delicious <UNK> <UNK> delivers exactly what i'm after: flavour! and lots of it. service was friendly however a bit slow for my party's <UNK>, tuna tartare, oatcakes, and donairs are what we tried. 4.5 stars!",halifax donair all the way. back room for a reso is a must. great space for a 8 - 12 person party. didnt have the seafood platter but have heard good things. same goes for the scallops. the notorious pig was a hit with our group.
zSQs_cDOOyjnTHREy9yRfQ,"This place has a salsa bar that features a wide variety of different salsas that are very good, and also features a very good guacamole. They have a variety of tacos, featuring different meats, that are recommended. The rice isn't very good and prices are a bit high for what you get. Overall this place is recommended.","This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is delicious, the service is top notch. I had the carne asada tacos and they were delicious. The salsa bar was also very good. If you want authentic Mexican food, this is the place.","after living in tucson for many years, i am always skeptical of mexican restaurants. that being said, they have the most authentic tacos on kent. i have only eaten here once, but i will be back. i wish they offered margaritas on the rocks instead of always frozen. the guacamole was great and i love a good salsa and hot sauce bar.","this place was ok. you can't go wrong with a variety of salsas. my burrito was good, but the rice inside lacked flavor. i was left with a mouth full of bland flavoring and had to constantly add sauces and salsa to every bite to give it taste. price wasn't bad. portions were nice. just lacking in flavor and taste.",went here for the first time a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed <UNK> a little confused about the ordering system. the prices are also a little much but the food was very good. had the grilled fish tacos and the queso and they were both wonderful! highly recommend if you're looking to get away from chipotle or taco bell.,"i have eaten at fresco three times. the first two times i didn't have any complaints about the food. the tacos are really good. the last time i ordered take out, the chicken was slightly overcooked and dry. the prices are a little high, but the service is fast. i would eat here again.","i ordered the water street with chicken. i got the water street with beef. the manager quickly fixed my order. fantastic customer service. 5 stars. follow up. my second burrito got me sick. the rice was hard and there was hardly any chicken or fillings. i have food poisoning, and i will not return to this <UNK>!","i had a quesadilla. it was one of the best i have ever had. the staff was friendly and helpful. the frozen sangria is delicious, but quite strong. the salsa bar was a little underwhelming, but it is more than made up for by everything else. i would recommend highly!",this is a nice spot that offers gluten free options. we've eaten here a couple of times- love the salsa bar (<UNK>!!!) and the guac is pretty decent. the sidewalk patio is a great place to hang out in the summer.,"i asked the girl at the counter what was best. she recommended the pork tacos and i was very happy with them. the salsa bar is a cute gimmick, but i'd rather have one really good salsa than ten mediocre ones."
zvB0Vzhomsodw_iQ7FHY1Q,"The BBQ here is highly recommended. The ribs, brisket, and all of the sides like coleslaw, BBQ beans, and fries are delicious. The ribs in particular are full of meat and are very tender. However, it might be wise to avoid Sunday brunch as the food tends to be dry and burnt.","This place is the best BBQ I've ever had in my life. The brisket was tender and flavorful. The ribs were very tender and cooked perfectly. If you're looking for a good BBQ, this is the place to go!",omg.... a must. we stopped by after puro cigar lounge and had some of the best barbecue ever!! my girlfriends ribs were falling off the bone and the flavor was amazing. no knife required. the same with my brisket. could hardly pick it up with a fork. owner and crew very nice. we'll definitely be back. :),"sadly, was not impressed. sunday brunch, ribs tasted as if they were left from 1 or 2 days ago. meat was very burnt and dry. i was really wanting to like this place. potato salad tasted like store bought, and white beans tasted like out of a can. hubby said brisket was enjoyable so 2 stars for that.","this barbecue joint certainly has a lot to offer it definitely can compete with any barbecue in town or out of town. imho, their brisket is top-shelf and you're not like all you can eat catfish. my personal favorite is white beans i like them just like they <UNK>. shane was our server the certainly prettiest helpful i highly recommend the joint",food was terrific and the spicy barbecue sauce was super yummy. service was not so great. took a long time for the waitress to take our order. luckily we were not in a hurry. food took a long time to arrive and the restaurant was not that busy - only about 8 tables.,"wonderful food, must try bbq beans, crinkle cut seasoned fries, coleslaw and potato salad. my only complaint was the ice tea / sweet tea had the hint containers may not be completely cleaned well or not fresh enough. all in all i am coming back! great bbq!!! !","went to west alley <UNK> night and we were very happy to find excellent ribs. the rub used adds to the flavor of the meat. the ribs are meaty, tender and <UNK> plus is that around 7pm there's live music. we are looking forward to our next meal.","this place is totally legit barbecue! everything from the brisket to the ribs to the coleslaw and beans were absolutely amazing! and we even got a tour of the smoker. the service was every bit as good as the food, and we are coming back again","the best bbq i have had in a long time! since living in the south!!!! they know how to serve great bbq and a southern bonus... vinegar slaw on the sand which, superb! glad you are in chandler!"
